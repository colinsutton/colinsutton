- ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @colinsutton
- ğŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in improving BIRT - I have been a user since BIRT 2.3.1 up to 4.8
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning git and github (after many years of using SVN and before that CVS and before that ...)
- I have been testing BIRT 4.9 development on Windows X64, MacOS Intel64 and Silicon.
